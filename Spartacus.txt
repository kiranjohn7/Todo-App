the arena as a Gladiator. At first Spartacus did not obey to his master 
so he lied that if he obeys then he will get to see his wife, so Spartacus 
fought to see his wife it was his only hope, but his wife got killed 
mysteriously then he mourned for his wife and then became a
“God of Arena” with the crowds chanting Spartacus…Spartacus… 
he defeated the undefeated warrior (Shadow of Death) and became 
so popular.Then after finding out that his wife was killed by his own 
master Batiatus he felt betrayed and with his friends Crixus and Agron,
he led the slaves and killed everyone in the Ludus including Batiatus. 
Then he Gathered a great army with 10000 slaves including finest 
gladiators of that time and rebelled against Rome because Romans 
have not even considered the slaves as humans, they will kill, rape 
the slaves for fun. Then Spartacus killed many romans and finally 
got defeated by Crassus. Spartacus was a Inspiration to every Slave 
at his time and his name lived long as the Greatest Gladiator of all time.
